##### GPS

<a id="gps"></a>

The Neo6M GPS module integrated into the Velma drone computer provides essential location data for navigation and waypoint tracking. Here's how the GPS coordinates are utilized:

Data Acquisition: The GPS module receives PVT information in NMEA sentences through a hardware Serial pin on the Arduino Mega. These sentences include parameters like latitude, longitude, time, velocity, altitude, and satellite information.

Parsing NMEA Sentences: Relevant information is parsed from NMEA sentences, specifically GGA and RMC sentences, which provide latitude, longitude, and time data.

Destination Coordinates Input: Coordinates inputted by the user through the Blizzard remote control interface represent the desired destination point for the drone.

Calculating Distance: The Haversine formula calculates the distance between the current position and destination coordinates.

Calculating Destination Heading: Trigonometric functions calculate the destination heading using the atan2 function.

Incorporating Magnetometer Heading: The magnetometer provides more accurate drone orientation. Its readings are used to calculate the greedy heading.

Blizzard Integration: Utilizes GPS coordinates for various functionalities using the cheat code [Shepherd_r]. This mode guides the drone back to a designated home location and provides heading and distance information in case of a crash.

Waypoint System: Implements a waypoint system using GPS coordinates via the cheat code [Oversee_r]. This enables waypoint navigation and route planning.

NMEA-0183 Sentences for GPS Receivers
The NMEA-0183 standard formats GPS information into sentences. Some commonly used sentences include GGA, GSV, and RMC sentences. They provide data like position, fix type, number of satellites, speed, heading, and more.

##### Gyroscope

<a id="gyro"></a>
The MPU6050 module measures angular motion over time across the x, y, and z axes to determine the drone's rotational position. Additionally, it includes an onboard accelerometer to measure acceleration along the same axes. These gyroscope and accelerometer data are crucial for both Acrobatic and Self-Leveling Modes.

Motion Tracking: The combined data enables Velma V3 to dynamically track the drone's motion, velocity, and orientation during flight, forming the basis for flight control algorithms and maneuvering.

Derived Parameters: Velma V3 calculates pitch, roll, and yaw angles using gyroscope and accelerometer data, essential for flight stabilization, navigation, and control.


Data Analysis
Angular Velocity: The gyroscope measures the drone's rotational speed in degrees per second (¬∞/s) around the X, Y, and Z axes.

Gyroscope Drift: Over time, gyroscopes may experience drift, causing errors in angular velocity measurements. Velma V3 compensates for this drift to maintain accurate orientation estimation.

Acceleration: The accelerometer measures linear acceleration in meters per second squared (m/s^2) along the X, Y, and Z axes.

Orientation: By integrating accelerometer data over time, Velma V3 determines the drone's orientation relative to the Earth's surface, crucial for stable flight attitudes and self-leveling.

Combined Data Analysis
Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) Fusion: Velma V3 combines gyroscope and accelerometer data using complementary filtering techniques to achieve accurate and stable orientation estimation in real-time.
