this is my log file, under log.1, under velma_training_drones repo
if I was to start afresh, how would I do it, factoring in everything, right now its very chaotic, 
and everything everywhere all at once, I need to redo, mapping the schematics alongside the circuitry in real life etc, 
I need to set and cut my specs, and to have organisation, before I send everything back, this file will be deleted,


Ok, what am I doing, building a training drone that I will use to give myself and my team a competitive advantage,
the drone is to have piloting capabilities via blizzard, the blizzard can choose to transmit data via the radio, 
or via onboard transcievers, the blizzard can search and rescue the drone, at day or night time, by providing gps to blizzard
and algorithms, there is turtle mode, the drone can turn by reversing rotation, of two motors, 
stabilization algorithms via the accelerometer and gyroscope, to aid in flight practise, 
cruise and autopilot capabilities, to aid in long flight and videography, 
waypoint system, the drone and blizzard can record position velocity and time data, altitude etc, 
it can send this data out, go left or right, to both the blizzard and the drone, 
altitude and gps hold capabilities, barometer and ultrasonic sensor to aid in assisted landing, 
complex control via parent_console and child_console, and their gyroscopes, and their goggles gyroscopes, 
    the parent, during training mode will give and revoke control priority via a switch, during flight, the drone does the distinction, 
    the blizzard profiles, give admin, parent or child access to the drones, and changing the profile midflight can unlock a library of features that wasnt there before, 
acrobatic, selfleveling and autonomous modes, 
changeable interface, because the nano reads the channels, it can switch functionalities very easily,
