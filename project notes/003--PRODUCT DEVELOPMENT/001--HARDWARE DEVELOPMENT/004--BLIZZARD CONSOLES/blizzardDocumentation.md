Blizzard Console ‚Äì Project Documentation
üìñ 1. Introduction
Blizzard is the primary handheld controller for the Velma drone system, designed to provide secure, versatile, and intuitive control for mission-critical drone operations.

Key capabilities include:

Multi-console compatibility: One Blizzard can connect to multiple drones (one at a time), and each drone can connect to multiple Blizzard consoles via dynamic access codes.

Remote mission execution: Operators at different locations can seamlessly hand off drones between Blizzard consoles.

Pre-autonomy control: Enables human-guided take-off, landing, and mission execution before full autonomy is implemented, with future versions integrating vision-based autonomous landing on ground tags.

üéØ 2. Project Goals
‚úÖ Develop a robust handheld controller for mission-critical operations.
‚úÖ Implement dynamic security protocols for drone-console authentication.
‚úÖ Provide advanced interaction features, including:

Cheatcode entry system

PID tuning interface

Dynamic execution prompts

‚úÖ Integrate real-time data monitoring for safe operations (battery, GPS, orientation, flight data).

üßë‚Äçüîß 3. Core Design Philosophy
Security: Dynamic password authentication for Blizzard-drone connections.

Modularity: Hardware and software scalable across different drone models.

Usability: Intuitive keypad and digital encoder-based menu navigation.

Interoperability: Seamless sharing of drones between hospitals, delivery centers, and operators.

Hardware initialization: keypad, LCD, encoder, HC-12

Basic menu system for navigation

Real-time battery voltage monitoring with alarms

Display of drone data (latitude, longitude, altitude, UID)

Establishing communication protocols with the drone

üîπ 5.2 Advanced Features (Part B)
Nested dynamic menu system

Cheatcode input, validation, and execution system

Dynamic password-based security and authentication

Drone execution prompts (e.g. PID tuning, altitude lock, mission commands)

Real-time data streaming with alarms for out-of-range values

Glossary of terms

‚ö° Technical Notes Summary
Passwords: Always required for connection; dynamically updateable.

Voltage divider: Scales 9V battery voltage to 5V for safe Nano reading via analog pin.

Keypad: Matrix input for cheatcodes and menu navigation.

GPS + Magnetometer: Provides Blizzard‚Äôs PVT data and orientation for drone rescue and navigation.

Menu System: Always displays battery level, GPS data, altitude, and drone UID in screensaver mode.

Digital Encoder: Scrolls menus, adjusts brightness/contrast/variables, and navigates back or forward via click.

GSM Module: Enables receiving drone mission instructions from remote systems (e.g. hospitals).

Transceiver: HC-12 manages drone communication; requires robust send/receive scripts.

Cheatcodes: Unlock advanced functions not mapped to standard controls; stored within Blizzard and validated for execution.

Battery Management: Provides user alarms for low battery conditions.

Proximity Pairing: Drone prompts connection to Blizzard upon mutual detection.

Execution Prompts: Blizzard sends commands to the drone to execute tasks (e.g. altitude lock, PID tuning), streams real-time data for user monitoring with threshold alarms.

Bidirectional ACK System: Ensures reliable data transfer by implementing acknowledgment requests, responses, retries, and timeouts.
