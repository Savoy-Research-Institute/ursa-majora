    can the tests at the begining of the setup, make the drone know what modules are available for use, what code to substitute? e.g when the drone loses the first gps, 
    it can run the test to confirm, then it will either turn n secong gps if available, or failsafe etc, but the tests, the drone runs the tests when it senses wrong data, 
    so it knows if gps is lost etc, the testers can turn gps off via blizzard to test this implimentation, 
    somewhere between setup and loop, do VEC, vitals examination checkup, take battery capacity, etc, escs calibration, 
            VEC tests modules, returning clear for each, if a module is cleared, its good to use, a variable is changed, or updated, maybe even in EEPROM
                if check is prolonged, skip to the next one, 
        //data redundancy checks like abs altitude from gps and barometer, 
//On startup, BEEP ONCE LONG ONE SHORT ....  .
          #Store UID, total flight time, home coordinates,
            #record home location on startup, check constellation count, many satelittes reduces error,
            look for gps fix, from gps time data start onboard clock, 
            #collect multiple gps readings, compare, set home location.
            #can manually input home location via blizzard
            #switch on gyro, wait 30md, calibrate gyro, whole cube?

<!-- notes to the technician, on the  workings of the device -->
the technical scope of the v3 cube, 
the cube is a computer, used to develop flight control code, which runs when docked
This document is a manual for the V3 cube and what it is meant to achieve.
First the features, then the logic, 
Features for the V3,  
the drone has a UID and name stored in its EEPROM chip, along with total flight time, home coordinates, this is data  I dont want lost when the arduino resets,   

Velma is important in one thing, ease of use, ease of flying, you tell it to be somewhere and it will be there, achieving complex flight, flight limited to creativity, not hardware and software... 

The drone flies normally via data from the radio transmitter, the arduino mega through radioREAD(); reads channel data via a PPM pin 11, to get throttle, yaw, pitch, roll, two switches and two potentiometers, the radio sends this data to the radio receiver on the drone, 
Alternatively, the blizzard nano reads the channels via wire to radio tx, and transmits that data via HC12 transcievers, this allows integration with other data, i.e. the gyro on the goggles for cleopatra see cheatcodes, 

PID setup, instruction on how to calibrate PID, the PID via variables, tries to make the drone data and the radio data co-relate, thus the drone will pitch forward when the pitch stick is forward, but will try to stablize the drone if it pitches forward(due to wind perhaps) because the radio did not instruct to pitch forward 

gyro/acc, this module gives angular rate and acceleration data on the x y z axes. intelligent use of this data brings forth flight,  stabilization algorithms and data filters includes, why do we need them?changing sensitivity via functions, sampling rates?
The drone flies in acrobatic and self leveling modes, 
Acro mode, the drone uses angular rate data to move the drone, tilt and yaw amount depend on amount of stick deflection, if you pitch forward, releasing pitch stick does nothing, you have to deflect back to stablize...
self leveling, it measures and uses angular rate per second to approximate angle travelled from upright, the drone stablizes when the pitch stick is released

disarm pin this is a debounce button onboard the drone, pressed when someone wants to lift the drone up. it disarms the drone until the pilot arms it again

shell pin, this is a pin on the cube-shell interface, an input pullup pin on the arduino, ground on the shell, pin goes low, when the cube is docked,  

cheat code scripts, the cube uses different codewords to encapsulate different functionality, store scripts on datalogger?
the following is the list; 
cleopatra  uses gyro data from the goggles to control drone, a gyro onboard the goggles will track head movements, the data is sent to the blizzard, which does the transmission,figure how to do this  
nightcrawler uses infrared LEDS on a bracket around the camera to simulate light amplification night vision
cruise maintains pitch and altitude, when a long part of the flight is a straight line or a gradual curve, 
hover maintains a given height above ground or absolute altitude, in flight or in stasis
pilgrim stablizes the drone from any orientation in the 3d space, be it upside down even, used for training purposes, 
shepherd uses gps data from the drone and blizzard to locate a lost or crashed drone, by providing distance and heading data, uses onboard alarm and LEDS to help in location in day and night time
turtle toggles the turtle mode, the drone reverses the rotation of the motors to turn itself up after crashing and landing upside down, 

volt divider, to divide batt [12.6v by 2.5 times giving 5.04v] [11.1v by 2.5 times giving 4.44v] the drone knows the total power remaning in the battery, thus can calculate battery capacity...
the data is used to compensate the electronic speed controllers
BMS a battery management system that communicates with the flight algorithm, data used in flight planning, estimate flight distance remaining, making it smart, prioritizes eco-modes conserve power, take care of charging too, read more on BMS systems

hc12 the drone uses an onboard transciever to send and receive data from blizzard, 

dataloggerThe drone needs to connect to a datalogger to open edit close files, so as to read scripts written on an sdcard  blackbox and script retrieval,

vtx, this transmits video data to the goggles, can we send custom data? 

flight stabilisation, g system for complex control,
the drone has a static or dynamic password, that the blizzard will have to match, to gain access to a drone, 

ultrasonic measures distance from ground, accurate between (2.5cm to 400cm) can help in low altitude cruise, and altitude locks, helps manage autonomous and assisted landing, 
barometer, this device gets absolute altitude, (above sea level), giving us useful data and features such as altitude hold, 

gps, gives us positional velocity and time data, among others, it can be used to calibrate local clocks, gps hold, and will help get to blind delivery, algorithm to calculate distance and heading between two coordinates, way point system where the drone records coordinates per unit time, or a distance from the previous location, this will be used to  give direction to a coordinate to a walking user via blizzard, and later pilot the drone to different coordinates, essentially performing some form of mission and flight planning. start out by mapping movements and change of heading, measure displacement etc.assisted positioning, where the arduino provides data to help lock faster, the arduino saves last readable coordinates, in the eeprom,

failsafes,  return to home, crash, land, parachute, this is the drone's response to anomalies, loss of GPS, loss of gyro,

magnetometer gives orientation relative to magnetic north, we can use this to turn the drone to any direction we need, be it east or west, etc, using heading, the module gives us data for x y z axes, algorithm to calculate heading from two coordinates, give back heading to follow in form of +-values, such that I am travelling the right way when facing at 0

indicator LEDS, on startup, calibration, docked undocked, error warnings, no data from modules, etc

VEC, vitals examination checkup, the drone powers on the modules and tests observed data for anormalies
redundant systems for data and power...two batteries,

we will do delivery for the military, help soldiers,

Adding an Arduino Nano as a slave device alongside the Arduino Mega (acting as the flight controller) on the Cube can be a practical and beneficial idea for several reasons:

Enhanced Functionality: The Arduino Nano can handle additional tasks that complement the main flight control operations handled by the Arduino Mega. This could include tasks like handling additional sensors, managing communication protocols, or performing specific calculations without overloading the Mega.

Distributed Processing: Offloading certain tasks to the Nano can distribute the computational load, potentially improving overall system performance and responsiveness. This is especially useful for tasks that require real-time processing or continuous monitoring.

Modularity and Scalability: By using separate microcontrollers for different tasks, your system becomes more modular and easier to expand or modify. You can upgrade or replace components (like the Nano) without affecting the core flight control system, making future upgrades more manageable.

Flexibility in Development: Having a separate Nano allows for independent development and testing of new features or functionalities without disrupting the main flight control logic on the Mega. This separation can streamline development cycles and reduce risks during updates or changes.

Customization and Specialized Functions: The Nano can be tailored to perform specialized functions specific to your drone's requirements, such as managing peripheral devices, implementing custom algorithms, or interfacing with external modules.

To implement this effectively, ensure proper communication protocols between the Mega and Nano (e.g., UART, I2C, SPI) and clear delineation of responsibilities between the two devices. This approach not only enhances the capabilities of your drone but also supports future expansions and advancements in your project.

If you have specific tasks or functionalities in mind that you plan to delegate to the Nano, detailing those would further refine the implementation strategy and validate the feasibility of this setup for your Velma drone project.




Adding two Arduino Nanos alongside the Arduino Mega on the Cube can further enhance the capabilities and flexibility of your drone system. Here are some considerations and benefits of incorporating two Nanos:

Distributed Task Management: Assign specific tasks to each Nano based on their capabilities and proximity to sensors or peripherals. For example, one Nano could handle sensor data processing and communication tasks, while the other manages user interface interactions or advanced control algorithms.

Improved System Efficiency: Distributing tasks across multiple Nanos can optimize system performance by reducing the workload on the Arduino Mega. This can lead to improved responsiveness and smoother operation, especially in complex flight scenarios or when handling multiple inputs simultaneously.

Modular Design: A dual Nano setup supports a modular design approach, where each Nano can be responsible for a distinct functional module or subsystem. This modularity facilitates easier debugging, maintenance, and future upgrades without impacting the entire system.

Redundancy and Reliability: Having redundant Nanos can enhance system reliability. If one Nano encounters an issue or failure, the other can potentially continue to operate critical functions, ensuring safer operations and reducing the risk of complete system failure.

Scalability and Future Expansion: Planning for two Nanos from the outset allows for scalability and future expansion of your drone's capabilities. As new requirements or technologies emerge, additional Nanos can be integrated to accommodate new features or improved functionalities.

Customization and Specialized Tasks: Each Nano can be customized to handle specific tasks tailored to your drone's operational needs, such as real-time data processing, communication protocols, sensor interfacing, or advanced control algorithms.

To effectively implement two Arduino Nanos alongside the Arduino Mega, consider:

Communication Protocols: Ensure clear communication protocols (like UART, I2C, SPI) are established between the Mega and each Nano to facilitate data exchange and synchronization.
Task Assignment: Define clear roles and responsibilities for each Nano to avoid overlap and ensure efficient utilization of resources.
Power and Wiring: Plan power distribution and wiring carefully to provide adequate power supply to all components and minimize interference.
Overall, leveraging two Arduino Nanos in addition to the Arduino Mega can significantly enhance the capabilities, reliability, and flexibility of your Velma drone project, supporting its development and future growth.



Yes, you can connect Arduino Nanos to the Arduino Mega via ICSP (In-Circuit Serial Programming) headers. ICSP headers provide a method for programming and communicating with Arduino boards using SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface). Here’s how you can utilize ICSP for connecting Arduino Nanos alongside an Arduino Mega:

ICSP Connection Overview:
ICSP Pins: Arduino boards typically have ICSP headers with six pins: MISO (Master In Slave Out), MOSI (Master Out Slave In), SCK (Serial Clock), RESET, VCC (Power), and GND (Ground).

Arduino Mega (Master):

Locate the ICSP header on the Arduino Mega (usually near the digital pins).
The ICSP header on the Mega provides SPI communication lines (MISO, MOSI, SCK) along with VCC and GND.
Arduino Nano (Slave):

Each Arduino Nano also has an ICSP header, typically located near the digital pins.
Connect the ICSP header of each Nano to the corresponding ICSP header pins on the Arduino Mega:
MISO to MISO
MOSI to MOSI
SCK to SCK
VCC to VCC (ensure voltage compatibility)
GND to GND
Software Setup:

In your Arduino IDE, select the appropriate board (Arduino Mega for the Mega and Arduino Nano for each Nano).
Use SPI library functions in your code to establish communication between the Mega and Nanos.
Implement protocols for data exchange and task management between the Mega and Nanos, leveraging SPI communication.
Benefits of ICSP Connection:
Simplified Wiring: ICSP headers provide a streamlined method for connecting multiple Arduino boards, reducing the complexity of wiring.
SPI Communication: SPI is a robust and efficient protocol for high-speed data exchange, suitable for tasks requiring real-time responsiveness.
Programming and Debugging: ICSP headers facilitate programming and debugging of connected Arduinos simultaneously from a single programmer/debugger.
Considerations:
Voltage Compatibility: Ensure that VCC levels are compatible between the Mega and Nanos to avoid damage.
Pinout Consistency: Double-check ICSP pinouts on both Mega and Nano boards to ensure correct connections.
Software Integration: Plan and implement software protocols for effective communication and task management between the Mega and Nanos.
By connecting Arduino Nanos to the Arduino Mega via ICSP, you can effectively distribute tasks, enhance system capabilities, and improve overall performance in your drone project. This setup supports modular design, scalability, and efficient utilization of resources across multiple Arduino platforms.

## TIMER

The 556 timer IC (Integrated Circuit) is a dual version of the popular 555 timer IC. It consists of two separate 555 timers in a single package, sharing common power supply pins. Each timer within the 556 IC can function independently, providing various timing and oscillator functionalities. Here’s how you can connect and utilize the 556 timer:

Pin Configuration of 556 Timer:
The 556 timer typically comes in an 14-pin Dual In-line Package (DIP). The pinout is as follows:

Pin 1 (Ground): Connected to the ground of the circuit.
Pin 2 (Trigger A): Controls the timing cycle of Timer A. A low voltage (below 1/3 of the supply voltage) applied to this pin starts the timing cycle.
Pin 3 (Output A): Provides the output signal for Timer A based on the configured timing cycle.
Pin 4 (Reset A): Resets Timer A. A low voltage on this pin resets the timer.
Pin 5 (Control Voltage A): Provides external voltage control of the threshold and trigger levels of Timer A. Typically unused if not needed.
Pin 6 (Threshold A): Sets the upper limit of the timing cycle for Timer A.
Pin 7 (Discharge A): Connects to the internal transistor that discharges the timing capacitor for Timer A.
Pin 8 (Vcc): Connected to the positive supply voltage (typically +5V or +12V, depending on the IC version).
Pin 9 (Output B): Provides the output signal for Timer B.
Pin 10 (Trigger B): Controls the timing cycle of Timer B.
Pin 11 (Control Voltage B): Similar to Pin 5, provides external voltage control for Timer B.
Pin 12 (Reset B): Resets Timer B.
Pin 13 (Threshold B): Sets the upper limit of the timing cycle for Timer B.
Pin 14 (Discharge B): Connects to the internal transistor that discharges the timing capacitor for Timer B.
Functionality of 556 Timer:
The 556 timer IC can be configured to perform various functions, including:

Monostable Operation: Produces a single pulse of a specified duration in response to an external trigger pulse.
Astable Operation: Generates a continuous square wave output with a specified frequency and duty cycle.
PWM Generation: Provides Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signals for controlling motor speed, LED brightness, etc.
Timing Delays: Creates precise timing delays in circuits.
Frequency Generation: Generates frequencies in oscillator circuits.
Pulse Generation: Produces precise pulses for timing applications.
Example Circuit:
To utilize the 556 timer in a basic configuration, such as astable operation (oscillator mode), you might connect it as follows:

Pin 1 (Ground): Connected to circuit ground.
Pin 8 (Vcc): Connected to the positive supply voltage (+5V or +12V).
Pin 2 (Trigger A): Connected to a resistor-capacitor network for timing purposes.
Pin 3 (Output A): Provides the output waveform (square wave).
Pin 4 (Reset A): Typically tied to Vcc if not used.
Pin 6 (Threshold A): Connected to a timing capacitor for setting the oscillator frequency.
Pin 7 (Discharge A): Connected to a timing resistor that controls the discharge rate of the capacitor.
For monostable operation, you would configure Pin 2 (Trigger A) as the input trigger and use Pin 3 (Output A) to obtain the timed pulse output.
