This document outlines the functionality of the camera control system and the motorized gimbal in the Ursa Minor drone system. It describes how the camera is operated and stabilized during flight, enhancing the drone's capability to capture high-quality imagery and video.

Overview
The camera control system and motorized gimbal work in tandem to ensure smooth and stable footage during flight. This system enables the drone to maintain a consistent camera angle and orientation, compensating for any movements or vibrations that occur while in the air.

1. Camera Control System
The camera control system allows operators to adjust the camera settings and angle remotely. This is crucial for capturing the desired images and video in various flight conditions.

1.1. Camera Features
    Adjustable Tilt and Pan:
The camera can tilt up and down and pan left and right to capture footage from different angles.
    Resolution Settings:
Operators can choose from various resolution settings to balance image quality and storage needs.
    Video Frame Rates:
Options for different frame rates are available to suit the desired cinematic effect or real-time analysis.

1.2. Control Interface
    User Input:
Camera settings can be adjusted via the Blizzard ground station interface, including:
Changing resolution and frame rates.
Controlling tilt and pan movements through joystick inputs or touchscreen controls or a gyroscope on the goggles
    Feedback Mechanisms:
The interface displays current camera settings and provides visual feedback on the camera’s orientation.

2. Motorized Gimbal
The motorized gimbal stabilizes the camera, allowing for smooth video capture even during drone maneuvers.

2.1. Gimbal Components
    Motors:
The gimbal is equipped with brushless motors that allow for precise control over the camera’s orientation.
    Sensors:
IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensors detect the drone’s movements and adjust the gimbal to counteract any tilt, roll, or yaw.

2.2. Stabilization Features
    Three-Axis Stabilization:
The gimbal provides stabilization across three axes (pitch, roll, yaw) to ensure steady footage.
    Dynamic Adjustments:
The gimbal actively compensates for drone movements, such as sudden changes in speed or direction, maintaining a level horizon.

3. Integration of Camera Control and Gimbal
The camera control system and motorized gimbal are closely integrated to enhance the overall functionality of the drone.

3.1. Coordinated Movements
    Synchronized Control:
When operators adjust the camera angle, the gimbal responds dynamically to ensure stability, providing a seamless viewing experience.
    Automatic Horizon Leveling:
The system automatically levels the camera based on the drone's orientation, allowing operators to focus on navigation and framing without worrying about maintaining a level shot.

3.2. User Experience
    Intuitive Interface:
The integration of camera control and gimbal operation is designed to be intuitive, allowing users to make quick adjustments without complex procedures.
    Live Video Feed:
Operators receive a live video feed from the camera on the Blizzard interface, enabling real-time adjustments based on the captured imagery.
