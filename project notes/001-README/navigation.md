The navigation system of the Ursa Minor drone utilizes GPS technology to provide accurate positioning and route planning. This system is essential for autonomous operations, allowing the drone to move efficiently from one point to another while avoiding obstacles.

1. GPS-Based Navigation
The drone’s navigation system is primarily reliant on GPS technology, enabling it to determine its geographical location with high precision.

1.1. GPS Modules
GPS Receiver:
The drone is equipped with a high-sensitivity GPS receiver that can acquire signals from multiple satellites, ensuring reliable positioning.
Differential GPS (DGPS):
If available, the system can utilize DGPS for improved accuracy, reducing errors caused by atmospheric conditions and satellite positioning.
1.2. Positioning Accuracy
Horizontal Accuracy:
The drone can achieve horizontal positioning accuracy of within 2-5 meters under optimal conditions.
Vertical Accuracy:
The vertical accuracy may vary but typically stays within 5-10 meters.

2. Navigation Algorithms
The navigation system employs various algorithms to process GPS data and control the drone’s movement.

2.1. Waypoint Navigation
Definition:
Users can define specific waypoints for the drone to navigate to, allowing for pre-planned flight paths.
Implementation:
The drone follows a series of GPS coordinates, adjusting its altitude and heading as needed.
2.2. Path Planning Algorithms
A Algorithm:*
Used for determining the most efficient route between waypoints, taking into account obstacles and no-fly zones.
RRT (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree):
Utilized for dynamic obstacle avoidance, enabling the drone to reroute in real-time if an obstacle is detected in its planned path.

3. Real-Time Navigation
In addition to pre-planned routes, the navigation system supports real-time adjustments based on the drone's current position and environmental factors.

3.1. Sensor Fusion
Combining Data Sources:
The navigation system integrates data from multiple sensors, including IMUs, barometers, and GPS, to improve positioning accuracy and stability.
Kalman Filtering:
A Kalman filter may be implemented to smooth the position data, enhancing stability and reducing noise in the readings.
3.2. Autonomous Return-to-Home (RTH)
Trigger Conditions:
The drone can autonomously return to its home location if it loses signal or the battery is low.
Pathfinding:
The RTH feature calculates the safest route back to the home point, utilizing both GPS data and obstacle avoidance algorithms.

4. User Interface for Navigation
The Blizzard ground station provides an intuitive interface for users to monitor and control the navigation features.

4.1. Display of Navigation Data
Live GPS Feed:
Users can view real-time GPS coordinates, altitude, and speed on the Blizzard interface.
Map Integration:
An integrated map displays the drone's current location, waypoints, and any detected obstacles.
4.2. User Controls
Waypoint Setting:
Users can easily set and modify waypoints through the interface, adjusting the drone's flight path as necessary.
Manual Override:
Operators can take manual control of the drone at any time, overriding autonomous navigation.




# Navigation Testing Document

## Introduction
This document outlines the testing procedures and methodologies for validating the navigation capabilities of the drone. It focuses on ensuring that the GPS-based navigation system performs accurately and reliably under various conditions. The goal is to confirm that the drone can effectively navigate to waypoints, return to home, and adapt to changing environments.

## Testing Objectives
- Validate the accuracy of GPS data readings.
- Ensure reliable waypoint navigation and execution.
- Test the return-to-home functionality under various scenarios.
- Evaluate performance in different environmental conditions (e.g., urban, rural, and open fields).
- Assess the drone's responsiveness to navigation commands.

## Test Scenarios
1. **Static GPS Accuracy Test**
   - **Objective:** Verify the accuracy of GPS readings when the drone is stationary.
   - **Method:** 
     - Place the drone at a known location.
     - Record GPS coordinates over a specified time period.
     - Compare recorded coordinates with the actual location.
   - **Expected Outcome:** Recorded coordinates should closely match the actual location within acceptable margins of error.

2. **Waypoint Navigation Test**
   - **Objective:** Validate the drone's ability to navigate to specified waypoints.
   - **Method:**
     - Program a series of waypoints into the drone's navigation system.
     - Initiate the flight and monitor the drone’s path.
     - Measure the time taken to reach each waypoint.
   - **Expected Outcome:** The drone should reach each waypoint within the defined time and with minimal deviation from the planned path.

3. **Return-to-Home Functionality Test**
   - **Objective:** Test the return-to-home feature under different scenarios.
   - **Method:**
     - Fly the drone to various distances and altitudes.
     - Activate the return-to-home function.
     - Observe the drone's flight path and landing accuracy.
   - **Expected Outcome:** The drone should return to the home location and land safely within a designated area.

4. **Signal Interference Test**
   - **Objective:** Assess the drone's performance in environments with potential GPS signal interference.
   - **Method:**
     - Conduct flights in areas with known signal interference (e.g., urban canyons, dense forests).
     - Monitor the drone's ability to maintain accurate navigation.
   - **Expected Outcome:** The drone should demonstrate resilience to signal loss, utilizing other navigation methods (e.g., inertial navigation) if necessary.

5. **Dynamic Environment Test**
   - **Objective:** Evaluate the drone's adaptability to changing conditions.
   - **Method:**
     - Fly the drone in various weather conditions (e.g., windy, rainy).
     - Monitor its navigation stability and accuracy during the flight.
   - **Expected Outcome:** The drone should maintain stable navigation and respond appropriately to environmental changes.

## Testing Metrics
- **GPS Accuracy:** Measured in meters; should be within 2-5 meters for consumer-grade GPS.
- **Waypoint Deviation:** Measured as the distance from the intended waypoint; should be within a specified threshold (e.g., 1 meter).
- **Return-to-Home Accuracy:** Measured by the landing zone; should be within a designated safe area (e.g., 3 meters).
- **Response Time:** Time taken to reach waypoints and return home should meet predefined benchmarks (e.g., within 5 seconds of command).

## Reporting
All test results will be documented, highlighting any discrepancies or issues encountered during testing. The format for reporting will include:
- Test scenario description.
- Actual outcomes versus expected outcomes.
- Any issues or anomalies observed.
- Recommendations for improvements or further testing.

## Conclusion
