This document outlines the data synchronization processes and protocols employed by the Ursa Minor drone and Blizzard ground station for seamless communication and data management.

Overview
Data synchronization between the Ursa Minor drone and the Blizzard ground station is crucial for ensuring accurate and timely information exchange. This synchronization supports real-time control, telemetry, and data logging, enabling efficient operation and analysis.

1. Data Types
The system manages various types of data, each with specific synchronization requirements:
    1.1. Telemetry Data
Definition:
Real-time data collected from the drone's sensors, including GPS coordinates, altitude, speed, battery status, and system diagnostics.
Frequency:
Telemetry data is sent to the Blizzard ground station at regular intervals, typically every second.
    1.2. Command Data
Definition:
Commands sent from the Blizzard to the drone, such as waypoint settings, flight mode changes, and emergency stop signals.
Structure:
Command data is structured in predefined formats to ensure reliable parsing and execution by the drone's flight controller.
    1.3. Log Data
Definition:
Historical data logs of flights, including telemetry data, command history, and system events.
Storage:
Log data is stored locally on both the drone and Blizzard for later retrieval and analysis.

2. Synchronization Mechanisms
Effective synchronization mechanisms are essential for maintaining data integrity and consistency.
    2.1. Communication Protocols
Serial Communication:
A serial connection (e.g., UART) is used for direct communication between the drone and Blizzard, allowing for high-speed data transfer.
Wireless Communication:
A wireless protocol (e.g., LoRa or Wi-Fi) facilitates long-range communication and data transfer, particularly for telemetry and command data.
    2.2. Data Acknowledgment
Confirmation Signals:
Upon receiving data, the receiving end (Blizzard or drone) sends acknowledgment signals back to confirm successful reception.
Error Handling:
If acknowledgment is not received within a specified timeframe, the sending device will attempt to resend the data.
    
3. Data Management
Proper data management practices ensure organized storage and easy access to critical information.
    3.1. Data Storage Structure
Local Storage:
Both the drone and Blizzard utilize SD cards or internal memory to store telemetry and log data.
Data Compression:
Data may be compressed to save storage space, especially for lengthy flight logs.
    3.2. Data Retrieval
User Access:
Users can retrieve log data via the Blizzard interface, with options to filter by date, flight, or specific parameters.
Export Options:
Data can be exported in common formats (e.g., CSV or JSON) for external analysis.

4. Real-Time Data Sync
The system supports real-time data synchronization, allowing for immediate updates and control.
    4.1. Live Telemetry Monitoring
Data Streaming:
Telemetry data is streamed live to the Blizzard interface, providing operators with up-to-date information about the drone's status.
    4.2. Command Execution Feedback
Execution Confirmation:
The drone provides feedback to the Blizzard upon successful execution of commands, ensuring operators are informed of the system's state.
