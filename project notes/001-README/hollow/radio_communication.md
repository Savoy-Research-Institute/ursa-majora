This document outlines the communication system between the drone (Velma) and the ground station (Blizzard) using radio and transceivers. It covers the protocols, data packets, error handling, and fail-safe mechanisms involved in maintaining a reliable communication link.

Purpose
Radio communication is critical for transmitting:

Control commands from the ground station (Blizzard) to the drone (Velma).
Telemetry data (GPS, altitude, battery status) from the drone to Blizzard.
Video feed or real-time data during flight.
Maintaining a stable, low-latency connection is essential to ensure that the drone can be piloted safely, and that data transmission remains accurate throughout flight operations.

Hardware Components
1. HC-12 Transceiver Modules
Range: Up to 1 km (line of sight), configurable for both high-speed and long-range communication.
Frequency Band: 433 MHz, using FSK (Frequency Shift Keying) modulation.
Role:
Transmit commands from the Blizzard to the drone.
Send telemetry data and status updates from the drone back to the Blizzard.
2. Radio Array on Blizzard
Consists of a radio receiver for redundancy and enhanced communication range.
Automatically switches channels or modules if interference or signal loss occurs.
Antenna Placement ensures clear line-of-sight communication.

Communication Protocols and Data Flow
1. Command Transmission
Control signals (e.g., throttle, yaw, pitch, roll) are encoded as PWM values and transmitted via HC-12 modules.
The flight controller receives these commands and converts them to motor speed changes and actuator adjustments.
2. Telemetry Data Transmission
Telemetry data includes:
GPS coordinates
Altitude (barometer, GPS, ultrasonic)
Battery status (voltage, temperature from thermocouple)
Orientation (gyroscope, accelerometer)
Sent periodically in packets to the Blizzard to provide real-time feedback to the pilot.

Data Packet Structure
Command Packet:
[Header] [Command Type] [Control Values] [Checksum]
Example: Header = Start Byte, Command Type = Throttle, Control Values = PWM, Checksum = CRC-8.

Telemetry Packet:
[Header] [Data Type] [Sensor Values] [Checksum]
Example: Header = Start Byte, Data Type = GPS, Sensor Values = Latitude/Longitude, Checksum = CRC-8.

Error Checking:
Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC-8) ensures data integrity and detects corrupted packets.
If a packet fails validation, the system triggers a retransmission request.

Communication Modes
1. Manual Mode
In manual mode, the pilot uses the controls on Blizzard to send direct inputs to the drone.
The drone continuously sends telemetry updates to assist with piloting decisions.
2. Autonomous Mode
In autonomous mode, the drone executes a pre-programmed flight plan stored in memory.
The Blizzard monitors telemetry data and can override the autonomous flight in case of emergency.
3. Failsafe Mode
If the signal is lost between Blizzard and the drone:
The drone switches to Failsafe Return-to-Home (RTH) mode.
Uses GPS to navigate back to either the initial home point or Blizzard’s current location.
An audio and visual alert (via buzzer and LEDs) is triggered on the Blizzard to notify the pilot of signal loss.

Radio Communication Challenges and Solutions
1. Interference and Signal Loss
Challenge: Radio frequency interference (from nearby devices, buildings, or environmental obstacles).
Solution:
Dynamic frequency switching to avoid interference-prone channels.
Antenna diversity to mitigate multipath interference.
2. Packet Loss or Corruption
Challenge: Data packets may get lost or corrupted due to noise in the communication channel.
Solution:
Implement retransmission protocols for critical data.
Use error detection algorithms (CRC-8) to identify and discard corrupted packets.
3. Limited Range
Challenge: Maximum range of HC-12 modules is limited to 1 km in open terrain.
Solution:
Use line-of-sight flying and ensure optimal antenna placement.
Use signal boosters or repeaters for extended-range missions.

Power Management for Radio Modules
Drone HC-12 Modules: Powered by the drone’s main LiPo battery.
Draws minimal power, but transmission intervals are optimized to conserve energy.
Blizzard HC-12 Modules: Powered by a 9V battery with voltage regulation.
Includes sleep modes to save power during idle periods.

Security Measures
Encryption:
Implement AES-128 encryption for secure communication to prevent unauthorized access.

Authentication:
Use handshake protocols to ensure only authenticated devices (Blizzard and Velma) communicate with each other.
Failsafe Mechanism: Return-to-Home (RTH)
If the communication link drops for more than 5 seconds, the drone initiates RTH mode.
The drone follows the pre-programmed altitude and GPS path to safely return to the home location or Blizzard’s current position.
If the battery is critically low, the drone lands at the nearest safe location.

System Feedback and Monitoring
LED Indicators:
Flashing LEDs on Blizzard indicate signal strength and communication status.
Audio Alerts:
The buzzer sounds if communication is lost, or during mode changes (e.g., Manual to Autonomous).
Real-Time Display on LCD Screen:
Shows telemetry data (e.g., altitude, speed, GPS) and status of the radio connection.

Future Improvements
Mesh Network Setup:
Deploying multiple radio modules in a mesh configuration for extended range and redundancy.
Adaptive Transmission Rates:
Adjust transmission frequency dynamically based on distance, signal quality, and environmental conditions.
