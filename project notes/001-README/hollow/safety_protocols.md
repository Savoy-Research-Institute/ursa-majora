This document outlines the safety protocols for the Ursa Minor drone system, focusing on ensuring the safe operation of both the drone (Velma) and the ground station (Blizzard). These protocols are designed to minimize risks and enhance user safety during flight operations.

Overview of Safety Protocols
Safety is paramount in drone operations. The protocols defined herein cover pre-flight checks, in-flight operations, emergency procedures, and maintenance practices to ensure a secure operating environment.

1. Pre-Flight Safety Checks
Before any flight, operators must conduct a series of checks to verify that all systems are functioning correctly.
  1.1. Equipment Inspection
Drone (Velma):
Check for physical damage on the frame, rotors, and camera systems.
Verify that all motors are operational.
Ensure the battery is securely attached and fully charged.
Ground Station (Blizzard):
Confirm that all connections are secure (USB, antennas, etc.).
Check the battery level and replace if necessary.
Verify that the LCD and LED indicators function correctly.
  1.2. System Calibration
GPS Calibration:
Ensure GPS is calibrated and receiving a strong signal.
Gyroscope Calibration:
Calibrate the gyroscope to ensure stable flight behavior.
Barometer Check:
Verify altitude readings are accurate.

2. In-Flight Safety Operations
During flight, operators should adhere to the following guidelines to maintain safety:
  2.1. Maintain Line of Sight
Always keep the drone within visual range to avoid obstacles and ensure safe maneuvering.
  2.2. Follow Local Regulations
Comply with all local laws regarding drone flight, including no-fly zones and altitude restrictions.
  2.3. Monitor Battery Levels
Continuously monitor battery levels via the LCD on the Blizzard and be prepared for an immediate return-to-home (RTH) if levels become critically low.
  2.4. Emergency Protocols
In the event of a loss of control or communication:
Initiate return-to-home (RTH) procedure.
If the drone is unresponsive, be prepared to switch to manual control if possible.

3. Emergency Procedures
Operators should be familiar with emergency procedures to ensure safety during unexpected situations.
  3.1. Low Battery Emergency
Actions:
If battery levels fall below 20%, the drone should automatically initiate the RTH sequence.
If RTH is not possible, prepare for a controlled landing.
  3.2. Loss of Signal
Actions:
If communication is lost for over 5 seconds, the drone will switch to RTH mode.
Monitor the situation via the LCD display and be ready to regain control if signal is restored.
  3.3. Mechanical Failure
Actions:
In the event of motor failure or unusual vibrations, land the drone immediately if safe to do so.
Utilize emergency landing procedures, ensuring a clear area for landing.

4. Maintenance Practices
Regular maintenance is essential to ensure the safety and reliability of the drone and ground station.
  4.1. Routine Inspections
Conduct visual inspections of the drone before and after flights.
Check all mechanical components, including motors, propellers, and cameras, for wear and tear.
  4.2. Battery Maintenance
Monitor battery health regularly.
Store batteries in a cool, dry place and follow manufacturer guidelines for charging.
  4.3. Software Updates
Regularly check for software updates for both the drone and the ground station.
Apply updates to ensure all systems are operating with the latest features and security measures.

5. User Training and Awareness
Proper training is critical for safe operations.
  5.1. Operator Training
All operators must undergo training covering:
System operation and controls.
Safety protocols and emergency procedures.
  5.2. Safety Briefings
Conduct regular safety briefings to keep all team members informed about operational protocols and safety updates.
