This document outlines the User Interface (UI) feedback mechanisms for the Ursa Minor drone system, detailing how users receive information and confirmations during operation, both for the drone (Velma) and the ground station (Blizzard). The goal is to ensure a clear, responsive, and informative interaction experience.

Overview of UI Feedback
UI feedback is crucial for ensuring users have a comprehensive understanding of the system’s state and performance. The feedback mechanisms include visual indicators, auditory signals, and haptic responses that work in tandem to create a seamless user experience.

Types of Feedback Mechanisms
1. Visual Feedback
LED Indicators:
Used on both the drone and ground station to convey the system status.
Color Coding:
Green LED: Normal operation.
Yellow LED: Warning (e.g., low battery, weak GPS signal).
Red LED: Critical error (e.g., motor malfunction, lost signal).
Flash Patterns:
Different flash patterns signify specific alerts (e.g., rapid blinking for a lost connection).
LCD Screen Readouts:
Displays real-time telemetry data such as:
Altitude, speed, battery level, GPS coordinates.
User prompts (e.g., “Calibrating GPS,” “RTH Activated”) displayed prominently.
Visual indicators for system health (e.g., battery temperature readings).

2. Auditory Feedback
Buzzer Alerts:
Provides sound cues for various events, enhancing situational awareness.
Sound Patterns:
Single Beep: Acknowledge user input (e.g., mode selection).
Continuous Tone: Warning alert (e.g., low battery).
Intermittent Beeping: Critical alerts (e.g., motor failure, communication loss).
Voice Prompts (Future Implementation):
Planned integration of voice feedback to guide users through operations and alerts, making it easier to manage tasks hands-free.

3. Haptic Feedback
Vibratory Motors in Blizzard:
Provide tactile alerts to enhance user experience, especially during critical events.
Feedback Patterns:
Short Vibration: Confirmation of button press or successful mode change.
Long Continuous Vibration: Alert for low battery or critical errors.


User Interaction Scenarios
1. System Startup
On powering up the Blizzard:
Visual: LEDs flash in sequence.
Auditory: Buzzer emits a series of beeps.
Haptic: Vibratory motors activate momentarily to confirm startup.

2. Flight Mode Switching
When changing flight modes:
Visual: LCD displays current mode (e.g., "Manual Mode").
Auditory: A short beep confirms the switch.
Haptic: A brief vibration provides tactile confirmation.

3. Critical Alerts
In the event of a critical failure:
Visual: Red LED blinks rapidly; LCD displays an error message.
Auditory: Continuous buzzer sound alerts the user.
Haptic: Extended vibration to grab user attention.

4. Real-Time Status Updates
While in flight:
Visual: LCD updates telemetry data every few seconds.
Auditory: Periodic beeps indicate successful waypoint arrivals or mode changes.
Haptic: Short vibrations confirm telemetry updates or significant data changes.

Future Enhancements for UI Feedback
Customizable Feedback Settings:
Users can adjust LED colors, sound volumes, and vibration intensities based on preference.
Integration with Mobile App:
Allow users to receive alerts and notifications through a companion app for added convenience.
Advanced Alert System:
Implement a system that categorizes alerts by severity and allows users to filter feedback according to their needs.
