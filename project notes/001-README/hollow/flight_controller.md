Overview
The flight controller is the brain of the drone, responsible for receiving data from sensors, processing pilot commands, and making real-time adjustments to ensure stable flight. It acts as the primary interface between hardware components (motors, sensors) and software algorithms that control navigation, stabilization, and flight modes.

1. Architecture and Design
Microcontroller Unit (MCU):
The flight controller uses a high-performance MCU capable of processing sensor data in real-time.
Example: STM32, ATmega, or ESP32 chips, depending on requirements for speed and memory.

Real-Time Operating System (RTOS):
An RTOS may be used to handle multitasking efficiently, ensuring critical processes like motor control and sensor data acquisition run without interruption.

I/O Interfaces:
Supports communication protocols such as I2C, SPI, UART, and PWM for connecting sensors, radio receivers, and motor controllers.

2. Primary Functions
Sensor Fusion:
Combines data from multiple sensors (gyroscope, accelerometer, barometer, GPS, etc.) to form a coherent picture of the drone’s position and movement.

Control Loop (PID Controller):
Uses Proportional, Integral, and Derivative (PID) algorithms to adjust motor speeds and maintain stability.
Runs at high frequency (typically 250-500 Hz) to ensure quick response to flight dynamics.

Command Input Handling:
Receives signals from the radio transmitter (through Blizzard) or autonomous flight instructions.
Translates stick movements into precise motor actions (e.g., throttle, yaw, pitch, and roll).

3. Flight Modes Management
The flight controller is responsible for switching between and managing the various flight modes:
Manual Mode (Acro): Direct control over rotation rates, with no leveling assistance.
Self-Leveling Mode: Automatically maintains a level attitude when controls are released.
GPS Hold: Locks the drone in place using GPS coordinates.
Return to Home (RTH): Navigates back to the set home location.

4. Sensor Inputs
The flight controller integrates data from the following sensors:
Gyroscope and Accelerometer: Measure rotation and linear acceleration for stabilization.
Magnetometer (Compass): Detects the drone’s orientation relative to the Earth’s magnetic field.
Barometer: Measures atmospheric pressure to estimate altitude.
GPS Module: Provides geographic location data and velocity information.

5. Motor Control
Electronic Speed Controllers (ESCs):
The flight controller sends PWM signals to ESCs to adjust the speed of each motor.
Motor speeds are adjusted in real-time to maintain stability and execute flight maneuvers.
Failsafe Motor Shutdown:
In the event of signal loss or critical failure, the flight controller can execute an emergency motor shutdown.

6. Communication with Blizzard
The flight controller communicates with the Blizzard ground station via the HC12 transceiver or other radio modules. This connection allows:
Telemetry Data Transmission:
Sends live flight data (altitude, speed, battery levels, GPS location) to the ground station.
Remote Mode Switching:
Allows the pilot to switch flight modes remotely via Blizzard's interface.

7. Failsafe Mechanisms
Signal Loss Detection:
If connection with Blizzard is lost, the flight controller activates Failsafe Mode, which can either land the drone safely or trigger RTH.
Battery Monitoring:
Monitors the LiPo battery’s voltage and activates a low-battery alarm if required.
Disarm on Crash Detection:
If an unexpected crash is detected (e.g., sudden deceleration or impact), the motors are automatically disarmed to prevent damage.

8. Firmware Updates and Calibration
Over-the-Air (OTA) Updates:
If supported by the MCU, firmware updates can be deployed wirelessly.
Calibration Procedures:
Gyroscopes, accelerometers, and magnetometers require calibration on startup to ensure accurate data.
Gyroscope Calibration: Performed at startup to eliminate drift.
Compass Calibration: Done periodically to align the magnetometer with the environment.

9. Real-Time Telemetry Feedback
The flight controller constantly sends data to Blizzard, such as:
Altitude
GPS Location
Battery Level
Signal Strength
This telemetry data enables real-time decision-making by the pilot or the autonomous system.

10. Startup Sequence
Power-On Self-Test (POST):
The flight controller checks the functionality of sensors and ESCs.
LED/Buzzer Feedback:
LEDs flash, and the buzzer sounds to confirm successful startup.
Sensor Calibration:
Calibrates gyroscope, accelerometer, compass, and barometer.
Connection to Blizzard:
Establishes communication with the ground station.

11. Data Logging
SD Card Logger:
The flight controller logs important flight data onto an SD card for post-flight analysis.
Usage:
Helpful for debugging, fine-tuning PID settings, and performance analysis.

12. Customization Options
Configurable Flight Parameters:
Parameters like PID values, throttle curves, and motor limits can be adjusted via the Blizzard interface.
User-Defined Flight Modes:
The flight controller firmware allows users to create custom flight modes tailored to specific applications.

13. Testing and Validation
Bench Testing:
Validate individual sensors and ESCs before assembling the drone.
Simulated Flight:
Test the flight controller's response to simulated inputs in a controlled environment.
Real-World Flight Testing:
Conduct test flights to evaluate flight controller performance under real conditions.
