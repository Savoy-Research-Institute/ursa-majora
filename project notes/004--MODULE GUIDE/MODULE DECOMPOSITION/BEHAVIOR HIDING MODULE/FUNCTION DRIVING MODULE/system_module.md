# System Module

This module serves as the central coordination point for all aircraft systems, managing system initialization, mode transitions, and overall system health. It coordinates communication between different modules, manages system resources, and ensures proper system operation across all flight phases. The module handles system startup sequences, shutdown procedures, and emergency system responses. It provides system status information to other modules and can implement system-wide safety features. The module includes system monitoring capabilities and can adapt system behavior based on operational requirements.
