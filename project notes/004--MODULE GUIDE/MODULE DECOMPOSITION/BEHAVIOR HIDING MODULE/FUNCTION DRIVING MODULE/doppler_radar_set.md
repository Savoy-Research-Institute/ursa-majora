# Doppler Radar Set Module

This module manages the Doppler radar system for ground speed and drift angle measurements. It processes Doppler frequency shifts to calculate aircraft velocity relative to the ground, providing accurate ground speed, drift angle, and track angle data. The module is essential for navigation accuracy, especially in conditions where GPS may be unreliable. It provides velocity data to the navigation system and can operate in various terrain conditions. The module includes automatic calibration and error compensation for different surface types.
