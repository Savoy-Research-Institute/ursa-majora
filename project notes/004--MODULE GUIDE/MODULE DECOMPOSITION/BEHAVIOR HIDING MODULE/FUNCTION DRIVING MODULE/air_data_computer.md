# Air Data Computer Module

This module is responsible for processing and calculating atmospheric data essential for flight operations. It receives raw sensor inputs from air data sensors (pressure, temperature, airspeed) and performs calculations for altitude, airspeed, vertical speed, and other atmospheric parameters. The module provides processed air data to other flight systems including the flight control system, navigation system, and display systems. It implements error checking and data validation to ensure reliable atmospheric measurements for safe flight operations.
