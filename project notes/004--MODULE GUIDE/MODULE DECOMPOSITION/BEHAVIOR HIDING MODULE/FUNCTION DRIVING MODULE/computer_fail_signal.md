# Computer Fail Signal Module

This module monitors system health and generates appropriate failure signals when critical systems malfunction. It continuously monitors processor status, memory integrity, communication systems, and sensor health to detect potential failures. When failures are detected, the module generates appropriate warning signals, initiates backup systems, and logs failure events for analysis. It implements multiple levels of failure detection including hard failures, soft failures, and degradation warnings. The module coordinates with other systems to ensure graceful degradation and safe operation during partial system failures.
