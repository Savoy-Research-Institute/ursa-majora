# Target Behavior Physical Model

This module defines the physical models for target behavior including target motion, characteristics, and response patterns. It provides mathematical models for target trajectories, signature characteristics, and threat assessment. The module includes models for different target types, motion patterns, and threat levels. It provides data structures and algorithms for calculating target behavior, threat assessment, and engagement planning. The module supports various target types and can adapt to different operational scenarios and mission requirements.
