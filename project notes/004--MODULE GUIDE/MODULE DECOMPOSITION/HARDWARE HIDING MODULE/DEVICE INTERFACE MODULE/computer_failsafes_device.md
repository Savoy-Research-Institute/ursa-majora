# Computer Failsafes Device Interface

This module provides hardware abstraction for computer failsafe systems including watchdog timers, redundant processors, and safety monitoring hardware. It handles hardware-level failure detection, system reset capabilities, and redundant system management. The module implements hardware-specific monitoring protocols and can handle multiple failsafe system types and configurations. It provides system reset control, health monitoring, and emergency shutdown capabilities. The module abstracts hardware-specific details to provide clean interfaces for the computer fail signal module.
