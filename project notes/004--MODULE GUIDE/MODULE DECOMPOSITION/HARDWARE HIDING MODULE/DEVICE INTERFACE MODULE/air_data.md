# Air Data Device Interface

This module provides hardware abstraction for all air data sensors including pitot tubes, static pressure sensors, and temperature probes. It handles raw sensor data acquisition, signal conditioning, and provides standardized interfaces for air data information. The module implements sensor-specific calibration routines and can handle multiple sensor types and configurations. It provides error detection and sensor health monitoring capabilities. The module abstracts hardware-specific details to provide clean interfaces for the air data computer module.
