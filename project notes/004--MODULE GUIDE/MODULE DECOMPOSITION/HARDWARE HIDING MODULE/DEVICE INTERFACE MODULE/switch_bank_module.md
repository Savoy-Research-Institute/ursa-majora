# Switch Bank Module Device Interface

This module provides hardware abstraction for switch bank systems including toggle switches, rotary switches, and push buttons. It handles switch position reading, debouncing, and input processing for various control panels. The module implements switch-specific communication protocols and can handle multiple switch bank types and configurations. It provides switch state monitoring, input validation, and system health monitoring capabilities. The module abstracts hardware-specific details to provide clean interfaces for the panel module.
