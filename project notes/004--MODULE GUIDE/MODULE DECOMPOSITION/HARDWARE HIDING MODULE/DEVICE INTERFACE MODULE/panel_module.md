# Panel Module Device Interface

This module provides hardware abstraction for control panel systems including touch screens, keypads, and control interfaces. It handles user input processing, display management, and interface control for various control panels. The module implements panel-specific communication protocols and can handle multiple panel types and configurations. It provides input processing, display control, and system health monitoring capabilities. The module abstracts hardware-specific details to provide clean interfaces for the panel module.
