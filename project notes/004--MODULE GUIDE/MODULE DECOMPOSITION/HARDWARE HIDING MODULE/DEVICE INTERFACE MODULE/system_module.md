# System Module Device Interface

This module provides hardware abstraction for system management hardware including system controllers, communication buses, and system monitoring hardware. It handles system-level hardware management, communication coordination, and system health monitoring. The module implements system-specific communication protocols and can handle multiple system types and configurations. It provides system control, communication management, and health monitoring capabilities. The module abstracts hardware-specific details to provide clean interfaces for the system module.
