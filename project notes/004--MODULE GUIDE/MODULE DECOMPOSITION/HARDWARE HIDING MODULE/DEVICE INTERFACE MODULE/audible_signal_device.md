# Audible Signal Device Interface

This module provides hardware abstraction for audible signal systems including speakers, audio amplifiers, and tone generators. It handles audio signal generation, volume control, and audio routing for various alert systems. The module implements audio-specific communication protocols and can handle multiple audio system types and configurations. It provides tone generation, volume control, and system health monitoring capabilities. The module abstracts hardware-specific details to provide clean interfaces for the audible signal module.
