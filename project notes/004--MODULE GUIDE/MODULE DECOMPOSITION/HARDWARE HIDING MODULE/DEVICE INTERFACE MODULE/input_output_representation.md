# Input/Output Representation Device Interface

This module provides hardware abstraction for input/output systems including digital I/O, analog I/O, and communication interfaces. It handles I/O signal processing, data conversion, and interface management for various aircraft systems. The module implements I/O-specific communication protocols and can handle multiple I/O system types and configurations. It provides signal conversion, interface management, and system health monitoring capabilities. The module abstracts hardware-specific details to provide clean interfaces for the I/O representation module.
