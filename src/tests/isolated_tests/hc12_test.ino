/*  HC12 Send/Receive Example Program 1
    By Mark J. Hughes 
    for AllAboutCircuits.com
    
    Connect HC12 "RXD" pin to Arduino Digital Pin 4
    Connect HC12 "TXD" pin to Arduino Digital Pin 5
    Connect HC12 "Set" pin to Arduino Digital Pin 6
   
    Do not power over USB.  Per datasheet, 
    power HC12 with a supply of at least 100 mA with 
    a 22 uF - 1000 uF reservoir capacitor.
    Upload code to two Arduinos connected to two computers.
    
    Transceivers must be at least several meters apart to work.
   
   Upload the following code and open the serial port monitor in the Arduino IDE to send/receive messages.

The functions "*.available()" reads the number of bytes stored in the Arduino's Serial or SoftwareSerial FIFO buffers. 
As long as there is a non-zero value returned by "*.available()", the "*.read()" function pulls one byte out of the buffer 
and the "*.write()" function sends that byte along to the other serial port to be read by either the computer or the HC-12.

The Arduino UART has a 64-byte receive buffer built into the hardware so any bytes of data that exceed the 64-byte limit will be discarded. 
The software serial also has a 64-byte buffer; however, the SoftwareSerial library can be modified to increase that, if required.

const byte HC12TxdPin = 5;                  // Transmit Pin on HC12

SoftwareSerial HC12(HC12TxdPin,HC12RxdPin); // Create Software Serial Port

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);                       // Open serial port to computer
  HC12.begin(9600);                         // Open serial port to HC12
}

void loop() {
  if(HC12.available()){                     // If Arduino's HC12 rx buffer has data
    Serial.write(HC12.read());              // Send the data to the computer
    }
  if(Serial.available()){                   // If Arduino's computer rx buffer has data

  }
}


/*In the first program, single bytes were detected and read from the serial buffer and software serial buffer and immediately written to the other serial port. The following program will read entire strings of data from the serial buffers and store it until a newline character is detected at which point it will write out the entire buffer.

The first program had no way to enter command mode and change the settings of the HC-12 transceiver. The following program can detect command sequences and change the settings of remote and local transceivers (provided they are running the newer version of the code). Note that it is important to change the settings of the remote transceiver first and then change the settings of the local transceiver to match, as any initial changes to the local transceiver will interrupt communication between the two.

The Arduino will collect strings from the serial port and software serial port. Once the new line has been detected, there is a check to confirm if the string is a command sequence (commands begin with AT+). If a command sequence is present, the local chip executes the command and transmits the command to the remote chip for execution there.   The code keeps the HC12s on the same channel at same power levels during testing.

Use caution as it is possible to accidentally lower the remote power level to a point that the remote transceiver can no longer communicate with the local transceiver. This is quickly fixed by broadcasting a new power level. Changing the baud rate can disable communication between the HC-12 and the Arduino unless the Arduino baud rate is changed at the same time.*/

    This code will automatically detect commands as sentences that begin
    with AT and both write them and broadcast them to remote receivers
    to be written.  Changing settings on a local transceiver will
    change settings on a remote receiver.

    Connect HC12 "RXD" pin to Arduino Digital Pin 4
    Connect HC12 "TXD" pin to Arduino Digital Pin 5
    Connect HC12 "Set" pin to Arduino Digital Pin 6

    Do not power HC12 via Arduino over USB.  Per the data sheet,
    power the HC12 with a supply of at least 100 mA with
    a 22 uF to 1000 uF reservoir capacitor and connect a 1N4007 diode in 
    series with the positive supply line if the potential difference exceeds 4.5 V.

    Upload code to two Arduinos connected to two computers 
    that are separated by at least several meters.
